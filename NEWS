SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o ppm
    Covariates which are functions may now depend on the marks
    as well as the spatial coordinates: function(x,y,marks).
    
    o mppm
    Covariates which are functions may now depend on the marks
    as well as the spatial coordinates: function(x,y,marks).
    
    o reach.kppm
    Now returns a result for LGCP models as well as cluster models.

    o distcdf
    Improved regularisation algorithm.
    Argument 'nr=NULL' is now accepted.
    New argument 'delta' allows the result to be interpolated
    onto a finer grid.

    o collapse.fv
    Columns identified by the arguments 'same' and 'different'
    may now be absent from some of the 'fv' objects that will be collapsed.

    o Kest
    When the argument 'domain' is given, the calculation of estimates of K(r)
    has changed slightly, to adhere more closely to the description in
    the help file.
    
    o reload.or.compute
    Now prints a message indicating whether the data were recomputed
    or reloaded from file.
    New argument 'verbose'.

    o update.kppm
    New argument 'envir'.

    'lambda' is a fitted model.
    
    o pcfinhom
    No longer issues a warning about changed behaviour in the case where
    'lambda' is a fitted model.
    
BUG FIXES

    o subfits
    The fitted interaction coefficients were garbled.
    If 'mfit' is the mppm object and 'a <- subfits(mfit)[[i]]' is one of the
    sub-models, then coef(a) was correct, but coef(fitin(a)) was incorrect.
    The fitted interaction was shown correctly by printing 'mfit'
    but incorrectly by printing 'a'.
    Fixed.
    
    o varcount
    The result was very inaccurate if the cluster radius was small 
    compared to the size of the window 'B', due to discretisation error.
    Fixed.

    o segregation.test
    The test statistic was calculated as the mean, rather than the sum,
    of discrepancies between probabilities. (The p-value was not affected.)
    Fixed.

    o Kest
    If 'domain' was specified, 'rmax' was ignored.
    Fixed.

    o edge.Ripley
    Value was incorrect for a point lying exactly on a corner.
    Fixed.

    o edge.Ripley
    Crashed when method="interpreted", if a point lay exactly on a corner.
    Fixed.

    o plot.fv, plot.envelope
    Crashed when trying to display a significance band of width zero
    around a constant function.
    Fixed.
    
    o collapse.fv
    Crashed if 'length(same) > 1'.
    Fixed.

    because an 'edge correction' was mistakenly applied.
    Fixed.

    o rhohat
    The rug plot (produced by plot.rhohat) was incorrect
    when rhohat was called with method="piecewise".
    Fixed.

    Fixed.

    o predict.slrm, fitted.slrm

    Simulation results for log-Gaussian Cox processes were incorrect
    unless the pixel dimensions and pixel spacings were identical
    on the horizontal and vertical axes. (If pixel dimensions were not
    specified, then the results were incorrect whenever the Frame of the
    simulation window was not a square.) 
    [Spotted by Tilman Davies.]
    Fixed.
    
    o Vmark
    Crashed if normalise=TRUE when there was only one column of marks.

OVERVIEW

    o Added NEWS file.


        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-0

OVERVIEW

    o Package initialised at version 1.65-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.core
    The package 'spatstat.core' has been created from a subset
    of the code in the original 'spatstat' package version 1.65-0.
    It contains the core functionality for statistical analysis of
    spatial data. For an overview, see help("spatstat.core-package")

    o Execution
    The 'spatstat.core' package is slightly faster than the corresponding
    code in the 'spatstat' package, because the procedure for calling
    internal C functions has been streamlined.
