        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 2.0-0

OVERVIEW

    o We thank Tilman Davies,  Greg McSwiggan and Suman Rakshit
    for contributions.
    
    o Diffusion kernel smoothing.
    
    o More support for spatial logistic regression models.

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o densityHeat, densityHeat.ppp
    Given a point pattern, compute the diffusion kernel estimate
    of point process intensity. This is an alternative to density.ppp.
    
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o slrm
    'step' can now be applied to models fitted using 'slrm'.


        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-11

OVERVIEW

    o Internal tweaks.
    
        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-10

OVERVIEW

    o Minor corrections to documentation.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-9

OVERVIEW

    o We thank Ian Buller for a suggestion.

    o weights permitted in density calculation for line segments.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o density.psp
    New argument 'weights'.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-8

OVERVIEW

    o Minor changes to appease the compiler.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-7

OVERVIEW

    o We thank Michael Chirico for a contribution.

    o Minor changes to appease the compiler.
    
        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-6

OVERVIEW

    o We thank Tilman Davies and Pavel Fibich for contributions.

    o Important bug fix in simulation of log-Gaussian Cox processes.

    o Increased speed for large datasets.

    o variance calculations handle larger datasets.
    
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o vcov.ppm, summary.ppm
    Variance calculations now handle larger datasets
    (using sparse arrays).
    
    o rSSI
    Accelerated.
    
    o overall speed
    Changes have been made to the internal code of spatstat 
    which should accelerate computations involving large datasets.

    o localpcf, localpcfinhom
    New argument 'rvalue'.

BUG FIXES

    o rLGCP, simulate.kppm
    Simulation results for log-Gaussian Cox processes were incorrect
    unless the pixel dimensions and pixel spacings were identical
    on the horizontal and vertical axes. (If pixel dimensions were not
    specified, then the results were incorrect whenever the Frame of the
    simulation window was not a square.) 
    [Spotted by Tilman Davies.]
    Fixed.
    
    o Vmark
    Crashed if normalise=TRUE when there was only one column of marks.
    (Spotted by Pavel Fibich.)
    Fixed.
    
    o nnclean
    Crashed if k >= npoints(X).
    Fixed.

    o print.ppm
    Crashed sometimes when applied to the result of subfits().
    Fixed.
    
    CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-5

OVERVIEW

    o Minor changes required by CRAN.
    

        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-1

OVERVIEW

    o Added NEWS file.


        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-0

OVERVIEW

    o Package initialised at version 1.65-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.core
    The package 'spatstat.core' has been created from a subset
    of the code in the original 'spatstat' package version 1.65-0.
    It contains the core functionality for statistical analysis of
    spatial data. For an overview, see help("spatstat.core-package")

    o Execution
    The 'spatstat.core' package is slightly faster than the corresponding
    code in the 'spatstat' package, because the procedure for calling
    internal C functions has been streamlined.
